# Todo_app
Wanted to learn more front-end development, so I followed a YouTube tutorial to create a Todo web application that used React, CSS, and HTML.

I followed Dev Ed's video (https://tinyurl.com/aupv9ym7) and learned how to implement a basic react file, then enhance it by adding HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
The overall functionality of the application works like a stripped down trello page. You can add items to a Todo list, check off the item when complete and 
delete items when you no longer want them in your list. You can also filter the todos by if they are completed, not completed, and see all items. I was also
able to save the todos, along with their attributes to local storage, so that when the page is refreshed all the data stays saved in the page.

This was a great project for me to learn more front-end skills and get some experiance working with HTML and CSS. Working with React was also really cool and 
I was surprised how easy everything was so easy to implement, test, and debug.
